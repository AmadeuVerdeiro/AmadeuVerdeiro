- 👋 Hi, I’m @AmadeuVerdeiro Born in Ourinhos, a small town in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. 
I moved to Portugal at the age of 19, I was still studying Fatec - College of Technology, but 
the challenge of a new country was more attractive.
In Portugal I learned a new profession, the opportunity they offered me, I took it and did my best, 
where the peak was to be hired to work in Spain, where I currently live, but now, with the new technologies, 
I feel the challenge of returning to the profession that has always fascinated me.
At this moment studying, and in the future, also to always fulfill the desire to do everything with excellence.
<!--Husband to a wonderful wife and father of 2 fantastic children.-->
